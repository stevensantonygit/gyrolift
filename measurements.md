# Measured Data & Purpose

We measure:
- Pitch, Roll, Yaw (Gyroscope)
- Acceleration in X, Y, Z axes (Accelerometer)

Why:
- To determine how stable the payload remains during ascent
- To assess how effectively the gyroscopic motors counteract motion
- To evaluate design performance for future flight control systems
