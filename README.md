# gyrolift
Our idea is to add a gyroscope in the payload and use the ESP32 to control the motors acting a gyroscope.
We are going to use carbon fibre for the payload box to make it light and steady.
We will also be using DC motors that are powerful enough to rotate aluminium disks.
The motors will be placed in three different directions to offset pitch, roll, and yaw.
We will add a gyroscopic sensor and a accelerometer from M5STACKS to measure the efficiency of the box.
